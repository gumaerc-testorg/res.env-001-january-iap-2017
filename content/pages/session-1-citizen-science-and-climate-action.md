Summary
-------

Objective: Provide an overview of citizen science and other collaborative approaches to science-based climate action.

Session structure: Two hours in a classroom, consisting of several lecture segments with Q&A.

Part 1: Climate Action Meets Community Science
----------------------------------------------

Review the goals and structure of the overall course, followed by two talks exploring the drivers of citizen science and community science, associated analytical methods and data collection.

Instructors: Rajesh Kasturirangan ({{% resource_link "570473f6-60a9-4f9b-bd17-0b806704e594" "ClimateX" %}}), Britta Voss (USGS fellow), Jeff Warren ({{% resource_link "e029a2c1-18e9-4f66-a075-5811287c1b9f" "Public Lab" %}})

{{< resource 35fe4720-f97e-f539-f587-6df4919b7ccd >}}

Outline:

*   Community science: Why climate science needs a community approach (Britta Voss)
    *   Public disconnect from research and researchers, need for sustained & geographically distributed environmental monitoring, practical need to address immediate challenges facing frontline communities.

*   Renegotiating Expertise: Public Lab (Jeff Warren)
    *   What are the objectives, how does it work, who participates, who sets the agenda, what types of questions can be answered, what are the challenges, how is it different from / complementary to "traditional" research.

Part 2: Stories from the Field—Methane Leaks
--------------------------------------------

Introduce and discuss a specific example of citizen science field work: methane leaks from the natural gas infrastructure.

Instructors: {{% resource_link "f2104c40-18d3-4ffe-a4fb-ce41a3f7f56f" "Nathan Phillips" %}} (Boston University), Audrey Schulman ({{% resource_link "1843d92c-644c-4736-8c1b-b37423e6c5e7" "HEET" %}})

{{< resource 82716287-1426-d98c-4a6c-d19ce51e076c >}}

Outline:

*   Why are methane leaks a problem for climate and the environment?
*   Why do leaks happen?
*   How are leaks detected, tracked, and repaired?
*   How can citizens get engaged?
